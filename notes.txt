#

users can see a list of the available maps because of ease of
use and this gives them a way to start using the webapp.

#

users can view a map because they need to see where the pinpoints are.

#

a map can contain many points because there will be
multiple points that they want to capture or checkout.

#

each point can have: a title, description, and image because
users need this information to interpret the pinpoints.

#

authenticated users can create maps so that they can record new stuff and share them with
other users and this authentification process would protect users' lists from "outsiders".

#

authenticated users can modify maps (add, edit, remove points) because we don't want static lists.

#

users can favourite a map because they might want to refer to it quickly and easily.

#

users have profiles, indicating their favourite maps and maps they've contributed to
so that other users may easily view whatever that particular user has made.

#

use http://leafletjs.com/ or https://developers.google.com/maps/
